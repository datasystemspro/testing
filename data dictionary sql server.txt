
The following query retrieves information about tables, indexes, views, triggers, and sequences in any database schema:





SELECT 
    t.TABLE_SCHEMA AS Schema_Name, 
    t.TABLE_NAME AS Table_Name, 
    'Table' AS Object_Type,
    NULL AS Object_Name

WHERE t.TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    v.TABLE_SCHEMA AS Schema_Name, 
    v.TABLE_NAME AS Table_Name, 
    'View' AS Object_Type,
    v.TABLE_NAME AS Object_Name
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS v

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    s.name AS Schema_Name, 
    t.name AS Table_Name, 
    'Index' AS Object_Type,
    i.name AS Object_Name
FROM sys.indexes i
JOIN sys.tables t ON i.object_id = t.object_id
JOIN sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id
WHERE i.type_desc <> 'HEAP' -- Exclude heap tables (no clustered index)

UNION ALL

SELECT

UNION ALL
